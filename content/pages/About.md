I didn't come from a tech background. My world was more of politics, economics, and law. Then I discovered python, R, the data viz craft, and the possibilities these offered. I wanted to get real good but didn't know how.

I started *The Data Curious* to change that.

In short, this website was created to:

  * analyze and visualize data I find interesting
  * explore ways to make my code or process run better
  * log notes on concepts or techniques I’ve recently mastered
  * share about related events or meetups I’ve attended
  * create a visual journal of data
  * and more!

All views are my own.

Why a website? I'm following the great advice of Datacamp's Chief Data Scientist, David Robinson, to [start a blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) and that of data viz expert, Alberto Cairo, to [write what you want to learn about](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2018/09/to-learn-visualization-write-about.html).

Feel free to look around. Maybe we can all learn something together.
